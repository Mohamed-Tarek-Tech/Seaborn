# Seaborn
I use seaborn library to make visualization for the different data. I used a dataset that is built-in in the seaborn library, like 'mpg' and 'penguins'.
I use many methods to visualze the data like displot, kdeplot, and histplot. In addition, I was trying to describe the methods and teh arguments that can be difficult to understand and demonstrate their functionality.
You can see my notebooks and tel me you opinion.
